Python Data Structures and Algorithms
No non-sense solutions to common Data Structure and Algorithm interview questions in Python. Follows a consistent approach throughout problems.

Objective
There are a plenty of resources when it comes to interview preparations on the internet. What prompted me to create this project was the dissimilarity across different approaches and the infused complexity of the code.

Feel free to contribute but please follow the Contributing Guidelines as I want to maintain the uniformity of the implementation of data structures and algorithms. Last time around, people bombarded with me with Pull Requests, Issues and Emails insisting me to merge their changes

The open source community has helped me a lot during my interview preparations and studies while I was in my undergrad. I always wanted to give something back to the community. In my endeavour to contribute something back, I will be uploading data structures and algorithms questions in Python in this repo. Feel free to contribute and get in touch!

Structure of the repository
As of now, the repository contains 3 main directories: Bookmarks, Data Structures and Algorithms.

Data Structures
Contains all data structure questions categorised into sub-directories like stack, queue, etc according to their type.

Array
Dictionary
Binary Search Tree
Linked List
Stack
Graphs
Circular Linked List
Doubly Linked List
Algorithms
This directory contains various types of algorithm questions like Dynamic Programming, Sorting, Greedy, etc. The current structure of this directory is as follows:

Dynamic Programming
Graphs
Greedy
Math
Misc
Sorting
Bit Manipulation

Things need to be done
As you can see, the repo is still in its infancy. Here are some key things in the to-do.

Queue questions
Algorithms
More questions in data structures, especially for graph, circular linked list, trees, heaps and hash.
